Experimental Mob AI aims to change the mob behaviour to increase the difficulty.

## Behaviours
| Mob Types | Behaviours |
| - | - |
| General | Sprint, Gap Jumping |
| Zombies | Sprint Jumping, Weaving |
| Creepers | Lunging |
| Witches | Area Regen |

Experimental Mob AI can be disabled for mobs.
- Smithed mobs without `expai.force_custom_behaviour` are not affected.
- Mobs with `expai.ai_changes_disabled` are not affected.

## Contribution Guidelines
- **Optimization and Efficiency**

Code should use most available optimizations, if possible, like macro caching and UUID selectors to gain more performance. TPS matters when mods and other datapacks are being used.

# Glacier Players
Glacier Players was bundled into EXPAI before being split. Glacier Players are designed to mimic real players.
